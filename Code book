Code book
This is the code book for tidy data set

1. Url = Download link
2. Path = Directory Path
3. Files = Recursive file creation
4. x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
5. x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
6. rSub = rbind subs
7. rLabel = rbind labels
8. rSet = rbind set
9. rSetNames = row set names
10. dataCombine = combine columns
11. merge = cbind the rest of the data
12. activityLabels = Activity Labels data
13. y_test_label - match y_test labels with corresponding activities
14. tidy_test - binding test subject, test activity and test set
15. y_train_label - match y_train labels with corresponding activities
16. tidy_train - binding train subject, train activity and train set
17. tidy_set - merged test set and train set
18. tidy_mean_std - data set with only measrements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
19. tidy_avg - independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
20. and Some Activity Labels
